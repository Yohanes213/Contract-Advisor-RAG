# Contract-Advisor-RAG

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for Contract Q&A, forming the basis for Lizzy AI's fully autonomous contract lawyer. The system combines the power of language models with external data retrieval to answer questions about contracts with high precision.

## Repository Contents

Data: Contains an Advisory Services Agreement used for model training and evaluation.
Database: Utilizes Pinecone for storing and retrieving document embeddings.
Chunking: Implements custom chunking and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from LangChain.
Embedding: Uses OpenAIâ€™s embedding model.
Vectorization: Stores vectorized text in Pinecone.
Implementation: Includes different methods like Basic RAG, Custom Prompts, Query Expansion, RetrievalQA, and Autogen Implementation.
Evaluation: Uses RAGAS metrics for evaluation and visualization.
