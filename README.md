# Contract-Advisor-RAG

## Overview

The objective is to build, evaluate, and improve a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for Contract Q&A, simulating interaction with a contract by asking questions and getting precise answers.

## Business Objective

Lizzy AI, an early-stage Israeli startup, is developing a next-generation contract AI to create a fully autonomous artificial contract lawyer. Our goal is to build a powerful contract assistant that can independently draft, review, and negotiate contracts end-to-end without human assistance.
